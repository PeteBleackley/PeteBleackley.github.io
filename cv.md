#### Research Engineer
**BBC Research and Development** April 2001 - July 2011

Projects included:
* Extracting semantic data from free text. I created a database of timed segments of programmes from the BBC's archive catalogue, and investigated techniques for analysing subtitles, and applications for this data. I later reimplemented one of the algorithms I had investigated and contributed it to the [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) topic modelling library.
* [CALLAS](http://callas-newmedia.eu) A European Collaborative project to investigate Affective Computing
techniques for interactive storytelling. 
* Artificial intelligence techniques for broadcast chain diagnostics. Identified suitable technology, and prototyped, using C++.
* Investigating suitable parameters for a low-delay MPEG 2 coder. Software simulation to inform hardware design using C++.
* Hardware implementation of the Dirac video codec. Created Open Source circuits for arithmetic coding / decoding and exp-golomb coding /decoding. Refined algorithms to make them suitable for hardware implementation.

### Education
