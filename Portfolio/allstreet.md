# All Street Research

## The Client

[All Street Research](https://www.allstreet.org/)

## The Problem

All Street Research wanted to be able to find the most relevant paragraphs of corporate documents related to given themes.

## The Approach

A set of key words and phrases was obtained for each of the topics of interest. Then, from a corpus of corporate documents, words which correlated with the key words on a paragraph level were identified. These correlations were used to derive a scoring function for each theme that was used to identify the most relevant paragraphs.
