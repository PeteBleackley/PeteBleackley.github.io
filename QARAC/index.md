title: QARAC

# QARAC

In February 2023, the hype and controversy surrounding ChatGPT prompted me to write an article about [The Future of NLP]({% link QARAC/future-of-nlp.md %}), in which I argued that *future generations of NLP models will have to incorporate knowledge and a concept of logical consistency*.

Subsequently, I decided to start a research project to try to put these ideas into practice. The approach I chose is outlined in [QARAC: Question Answering, Reasoning and Consistency]({% link QARAC/quarac-question-answering-reasoning-and_consistency.md %}). I outlined my architecture, base models, and the data sets I intend to use to train them in [QARAC: Models and Corpora]({% link QARAC/qarac-models-and-datasets.md %}). After initially developing the models with Tensorflow, I found it necessary to port them to PyTorch, as described in [QARAC: Porting to PyTorch]({% link QARAC/qarac-porting-to-pytorch.md %}).

Development of QARAC is currently paused until I have the resources to train the models. This page will be updated when that happens.
