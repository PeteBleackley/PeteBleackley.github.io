title: Data Science Notebooks - The Grammar of Truth and Lies

#The Grammar of Truth and Lies

The issue of trust in the media is very important to me, and so when a dataset of fake news items was posted on Kaggle, I decided to see if NLP could be used to distinguish between real and fake news.

I later presented this at two data science meetups and on my video channel.

Later, another corpus of real and fake news stories was published on Kaggle, giving me the chance to see if the results were replicable. Fortunately, it appears that they hold up well.
