# Data Science Notebooks

The pages in this section describe various projects I have undertaken with publicly avaialble datasets, mostly on Kaggle. They provide an opportunity to see practical demonstrations of my data science work.

[Clustering Proteins in Breast Cancer Patients]({% link Data-Science-Notebooks/clustering-proteins.md %})
: Using the Breast Cancer Proteome dataset, I identified clusters of proteins with related activity, and investigated using them to predict clinical outcomes. Illustrates [data reduction]({% link Key-Algorithms/data-reduction.md %}), [hierarchical clustering]({% link Key-Algorithms/hierarchical-clustering.md %}), [logistic regression]({% link Key-Algorithms/logistic-regression.md %}) and [linear regression]({% link Key-Algorithms/linear-regression.md %})

[The Entropy of Alice In Wonderland]({% link Data-Science-Notebooks/entropy-of-alice-in-wonderland.md %})
: Using Montemurro and Zanette's algorithm to identify significant words and sentences in the text of *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*. Illustrates [information theory]({% link Key-Algorithms/information-theory.md %})

[The Grammar of Truth and Lies]({% link Data-Science-Notebooks/grammar-of-truth-and-lies.md %})
: Using grammatical features to distinguish real from fake news. Illustates [latent semantic indexing]({% link Key-Algorithms/latent-semantic-indexing.md %}), [logistic regression]({% link Key-Algorithms/logistic-regression.md %}) and [random forests]({% link Key-Algorithms/random-forests.md %})

[Is It A Mushroom or Is It A Toadstool?]({% link Data-Science-Notebooks/mushroom.md %})
: Predicting whether or not fungi are edible. Illustrates [Bayes' theorem]({% link Key-Algorithms/bayes-theorem.md %}) and [information theory]({% link Key-Algorithms/information-theory.md %})

[Part of Speech Tagging]({% link Data-Science-Notebooks/part-of-speech-tagging.md %})
: A video, and associated Binder notebook, discussing different approaches to Part of Speech Tagging. Illustrates [Hidden Markov Models]({% link Key-Algorithms/hidden-markov-models.md %})
